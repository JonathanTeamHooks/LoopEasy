### Email 1: The Problem
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- "What's on your gym TVs right now?"
- "Quick question about [Studio Name]'s member experience"
- "Your gym TVs could be working harder"

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Quick question: What's playing on your gym TVs right now?

If it's cable news, ESPN on mute, or random music videos — you're not alone. Most studios have the same setup.

But here's the thing: Your TVs are prime real estate. Every member sees them for 30-60 minutes per session.

What if instead they saw:
→ High-energy workout content
→ Member PRs and achievements
→ Your brand, everywhere

That's what LoopEasy does. Curated fitness content, automatic member recognition, your branding. Runs itself.

$29-49/month. Takes 5 minutes to set up.

Want to see what it could look like for [Studio Name]?

LoopEasy

P.S. — First 50 studios get founding member pricing: 50% off forever.

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about LoopEasy.

Here's what Jessica M., owner of Iron Tribe Fitness, told us:

"Our members actually watch the TVs now. They love seeing their PRs celebrated on screen. It's become part of our culture."

The member recognition features are a game-changer:
→ PR boards (automatic when members log lifts)
→ Achievement shoutouts
→ Member milestones

Would you like to see what it could look like for [Studio Name]?

Best,
[Name]

- "The $49/month upgrade that builds community"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Your gym TVs are prime real estate. Here's how LoopEasy turns them into retention machines:

1. **Recognition → Retention**
   Members who feel celebrated stay longer. PR boards and achievements matter.

2. **Branded environment → Professional feel**
   Your logo, your colors, your vibe. Every screen reinforces who you are.

3. **Curated content → Better energy**
   No more CNN or random YouTube. Just high-quality fitness content.

It's $49/month for Pro. Most studios cover that with a single member staying one extra month.

14-day free trial, no credit card required.

Want me to set one up for [Studio Name]?

[Name]
