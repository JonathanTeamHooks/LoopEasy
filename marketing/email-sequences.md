# LoopEasy Email Sequences

## Cold Outreach Sequence

### Email 1: Problem-Focused (Day 0)

**Subject lines (A/B test):**
- What's on your gym TVs right now?
- Quick question about [Studio Name]
- The screens your members stare at every day

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question — what are you showing on the TVs at [Studio Name]?

Most studios I talk to say CNN, ESPN, or just random YouTube. Nothing 
branded, nothing that actually helps members.

We built LoopEasy specifically for fitness studios — curated workout 
content, auto-updating class schedules, member shoutouts — all branded 
to your studio.

$49/month. Works on any smart TV.

Would you be open to a quick demo? Takes 10 minutes.

Best,
Cody

P.S. We're offering the first month free for studios that sign up this week.
