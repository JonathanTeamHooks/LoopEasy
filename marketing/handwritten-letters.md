## Letter Template 1: Standard Outreach

**For:** General boutique fitness studios

**Handwriting style:** Casual, friendly

```
Hi [Owner First Name],

I was looking at [Studio Name] online — looks like you've 
built something really special.

Quick question: what are you showing on your gym TVs 
right now?

Most studios I talk to say CNN or just random YouTube. 
Nothing branded, nothing that helps with member experience.

We built LoopEasy specifically for studios like yours — 
curated workout content, auto-updating schedules, member 
shoutouts — all branded to your studio.

$49/month, works on any smart TV.

If you're curious, I'd love to show you a quick demo:
loopeasy.com/demo

Either way, keep crushing it!

P.S. First month free if you mention this letter.

## Letter Template 2: CrossFit Specific

**For:** CrossFit affiliates

**Handwriting style:** Casual, CrossFit language

```
Hey [Owner First Name],

Saw [Box Name] online — love what you're building in 
the [City] community.

Random question: what's on your box TVs between classes?

Most boxes I visit are showing ESPN or nothing at all. 
But your TVs are prime real estate your athletes stare 
at every day.

We built LoopEasy to fix that. It shows:
• Curated workout clips (think IG fitness content)
• Your WOD schedule (auto-updates from Mindbody)
• Member PR board (huge for community)

$49/month. Setup takes 5 minutes with a Fire Stick.

Check it out: loopeasy.com

First month on us if you want to try it.

## Letter Template 3: Yoga/Pilates Specific

**For:** Yoga studios, Pilates studios

**Handwriting style:** Calm, mindful

```
Hi [Owner First Name],

I came across [Studio Name] and was impressed by the 
space you've created.

I wanted to ask — what's displayed on your studio 
screens before and between classes?

Many studios I work with use this space for:
• Gentle movement demos and inspiration
• Class schedules that update automatically
• Member milestone celebrations
• Beautiful, branded content

We built LoopEasy to make this easy. It runs itself 
once you set it up, and it's $49/month.

If you'd like to see how it could look for [Studio Name]:

Wishing you a wonderful [season].

## Letter Template 4: Multi-Location Focus

**For:** Studios with 2+ locations

**Handwriting style:** Professional

```
[Owner First Name],

I noticed [Studio Name] has expanded to multiple 
locations — congrats on the growth.

Managing content across multiple screens is a 
challenge. Most multi-location owners tell me they 
just put cable on and forget about it.

LoopEasy makes it easy to manage all your screens 
from one dashboard:
• Curated workout content
• Schedules sync with Mindbody per location
• Member highlights
• Consistent branding everywhere

$99/month for unlimited screens across all locations.

Worth a look: loopeasy.com

Happy to do a quick demo if you're curious.

## Letter Template 5: Follow-Up (Sent 2 weeks after first letter)

**For:** Studios that didn't respond to first letter

**Handwriting style:** Brief, casual

```
Hi [Owner First Name],

Sent you a note a couple weeks ago about LoopEasy — 
hope it found you well.

Just wanted to follow up in case it got buried.

The short version: we help studios turn their TVs 
into branded, engaging content. $49/month, runs 
itself.

If it's not a priority right now, totally get it. 
But if you're curious: loopeasy.com/demo

Either way, hope [Studio Name] is thriving!
