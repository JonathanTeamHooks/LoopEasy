### Template 1: Transformation Story (r/crossfit, r/orangetheory)

**Title:** We finally upgraded our gym TVs — here's what we learned

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

Own a box in [city]. For years our TVs just showed ESPN or whatever 
YouTube playlist someone started. Members would glance at it but 
mostly it was just noise.

Finally decided to actually do something about it. After trying a 
few options, we landed on a setup that:

1. Shows curated workout clips (short-form stuff from fitness creators)
2. Auto-displays our class schedule (syncs with Mindbody)
3. Has a "PR board" where we highlight member achievements

The PR board has been the biggest hit tbh. People LOVE seeing their 
name on the TV when they hit a new PR. Creates some friendly 
competition and just makes the vibe better.

Setup was surprisingly easy — it's basically a web app that runs on 
any smart TV or Fire Stick.

Happy to share more details if anyone's curious about their own 
setup. Took us way too long to figure this out.
```

**Engagement strategy:**
- Reply to all comments
- When asked "what tool?", share LoopEasy naturally
- Don't push — let them ask

### Template 2: Question Post (r/crossfit, r/pilates)

**Title:** What are you showing on your gym/studio TVs?

**Body:**
```
Curious what other owners are doing here.

Right now we just have cable on (usually muted) but it feels like 
a waste. Members are looking at these screens constantly — seems 
like we could be using them better.

Thought about:
- Workout demos/tips
- Class schedule
- Member shoutouts
- Music visualizers during classes

What's working for your studio? Any specific tools or setups 
you'd recommend?
```

**Engagement strategy:**
- Post first, engage with all answers
- After discussion builds, share what we ended up doing (LoopEasy)
- Feels organic, not promotional

### Template 3: Advice/Tips Post (r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur)

**Title:** Underrated way we increased member engagement at our fitness studio

**Body:**
```
Run a boutique fitness studio and wanted to share something that's 
been working really well for us.

We upgraded our gym TVs from boring cable news to curated content:
- Workout clips that match our programming
- Auto-updating class schedules
- Member achievement boards (PRs, milestones)

The member achievement board especially has been huge. When 
someone hits a PR, their name goes up on the TV. Creates community, 
motivation, and honestly some healthy competition.

Members have specifically mentioned it in reviews and conversations. 
It's a small thing but makes the experience feel more personal.

The whole thing costs us about $50/month and runs itself. Way 
better ROI than most marketing we've tried.

Anyone else doing something similar in their business? Would love 
to hear other creative ways people are using screens/displays.

### Template 4: Help Request (r/fitness, r/yoga)

**Title:** Looking for good workout videos to display on studio TVs

**Body:**
```
Hey all,

Studio owner here. We're trying to find good short workout clips 
to display on our TVs — stuff that demonstrates exercises, shows 
proper form, etc.

Preferably:
- Short clips (30 sec - 2 min)
- Good production quality
- Variety of movements

Anyone have favorite fitness creators on IG/TikTok/YouTube that 
have this kind of content?

Or if you know of any services that curate this kind of stuff, 
would love to hear about it.

Thanks!
```

**Engagement strategy:**
- Genuine question that invites recommendations
- Can naturally mention "we ended up using [LoopEasy]" after getting answers

### Template 5: Tool Recommendation (r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur)

**Title:** Tools that have helped grow my fitness studio in 2026

**Body:**
```
Been running a boutique fitness studio for 3 years now. Wanted to 
share some tools that have made a real difference:

**Booking/Payments:**
- Mindbody (or WellnessLiving) — can't run a studio without it

**Marketing:**
- Later for social media scheduling
- Mailchimp for email (free tier is enough for most studios)

**Member Experience:**
- LoopEasy for our gym TVs — shows curated workout content, 
  schedules, member achievements. Members love it and it runs 
  itself. Like $50/month.

**Operations:**
- Notion for SOPs and team docs
- Slack for team communication

The gym TV thing was a recent add but honestly has been one of 
the better ROI decisions. Cheap, set-it-and-forget-it, and members 
actually comment on it.

What tools are you using that you couldn't live without?
```

### When Someone Asks About Gym TVs

```
We switched to LoopEasy a few months ago and it's been great. 
Curated workout content, syncs with our booking software for 
schedules, has a member PR board feature.

$49/month and runs on any smart TV. Setup took maybe 10 minutes.

The PR board alone is worth it — members love seeing their name 
on the TV when they hit a new PR.
```

### When Someone Complains About Boring Gym TVs

```
This is such a missed opportunity at most gyms. The screens are 
right there, members are looking at them, and it's... CNN?

We put in a system that shows workout clips, our schedule, and 
member achievements. Way better vibe. Members have actually 
mentioned it in reviews.

There are a few options out there — happy to share what we use 
if you're interested.
```

### When Someone Asks for Recommendations

```
For gym TVs specifically, we've been using LoopEasy. It's basically:

- Curated short workout clips (think TikTok/IG fitness content 
  but curated)
- Auto-updating class schedule (syncs with Mindbody)
- Member PR boards
- Your branding/logo

$49/month, works on any smart TV. We use Fire Sticks.

It basically runs itself which is the main appeal — we don't have 
time to manage TV content.
